# Debugger-Protocol-Demo-Function
The pdb library is a built-in Python debugger, and you can use it to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables and I used it to create a custom small function to see if breakpoints are working.
Next I utilized HTML, CSS, and Typescript to make an interactive interface for testing the breakpoints just like VSCode. The demo uses DOM to create a visual representation of the breakpoints.
In this example, breakpoints are represented by blue dots. Clicking on the code area toggles breakpoints on/off for the corresponding lines. The breakpoint dots are dynamically added to the code area, and their status (active/inactive) is updated visually.
